KLEIN_FIELD_SHIELD:"Klein Force Field Shield"
KLEIN_FIELD_SHIELD_DESC:0"Use force field to simulate the structure of Klein surface. Because it has only one face, it does not intercept the attack outside the hull like other force field shields, but rather uses force field deflection to induce attack energy to bypass the hull in space. It is essentially a dimensional defense rather than a pure energy defense."
