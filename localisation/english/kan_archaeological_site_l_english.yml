Hope Can clarify the truth here. \n\nStart special precurser event §H Flying Pants§!"
Strike_Witches_precursor.1.a:0 "Then let's go"
Strike_Witches_precursor.11.name:0 "Military alliance"
Strike_Witches_precursor.11.desc:0 "According to our deciphering, it seems that here is a military alliance formed by two interstellar empires in order to counter certain threats. The two countries are called the Chariot League and the Witch Federation. This seems to be a very important military station, and there may be new discoveries if you continue to explore."
Strike_Witches_precursor.11.a:0 "carry on"
Strike_Witches_precursor.12.name:0 "501 Unified Combat Aviation Regiment"
Strike_Witches_precursor.12.desc:0 "The name of the troops stationed here has been translated. They are called the 501st Unified Combat Aviation Regiment, commonly known as the Strike Witch. Their civilization is promoted by the so-called magic power. Among them, 501 seems to be the sharpest spear in their civilization. A long time has passed, but proof of their glory can still be found here. There is a place left in the center of the seemingly headquarters, which may have a deep connection with the 501 aviation regiment, and we should look for it."

Strike_Witches_precursor.21.name:0 "Neloilization of the fighting boot"
Strike_Witches_precursor.21.desc:0 "This seems to be the research room of the Witch Federation. The piles of materials and geometric figures that we cannot understand seem to prove this point.

Strike_Witches_precursor.22.desc:0 "At the bottom of the laboratory, there is a tank there! For the first time since we stepped out of the Xinghai Sea, we saw a war weapon close to the appearance of our civilization. The pattern on the tank also indicated that the Witch Federation wanted to apply technology to the tank. This tank seems to be provided by another civilization in the military alliance. , Translated into our language is Da Xi Military Industry. Before the power supply completely failed, we read a huge military operation called the Arrow of Victory by this federation, and the address was in our country!"
Strike_Witches_precursor.22.a:0 "What are you waiting for? Hurry up and have a look"
Strike_Witches_precursor.31.name:0 "Orbital Bombardment"
Strike_Witches_precursor.31.desc:0 "The desolate and uneven surface of this planet was originally thought to be formed by a comet collision. Our scientists have found that this is not the case. The deep crater here is formed by a huge fleet after endless bombing, and it is in the remains of the falling shells. Detecting the so-called magic reaction of the Witch Federation, we speculate that it should be an orbital bombing by the Witch Federation. A detailed report of the landing operation was found under one of the ruins."
Strike_Witches_precursor.31.a:0 "Translate, this is very important to us"
Strike_Witches_precursor.32.name:0 "Airdrop tank"
Strike_Witches_precursor.32.desc:0 "After translation, it was discovered that the battle on land was launched by the tank alliance, and the alliance members jointly attacked. The overwhelming tanks dropped from the sky above the fleet to the planet ground, and quickly broke the enemy's fortress and surrounded the planet's capital."
Strike_Witches_precursor.32.a:0 "carry on"
Strike_Witches_precursor.33.name:0 "Witch enters the battlefield"
Strike_Witches_precursor.33.desc:0 "It seems that the capital of the planet has not been captured even of the large-scale airborne tanks. It seems that their enemy forces have strong air superiority, and every further push will cause heavy casualties. According to communications, it seems that the Witch Federation has continuously invested 501 to 506 six aviation regiments here to compete for air supremacy, and the witches have entered the battlefield."
Strike_Witches_precursor.33.a:0 "What a grand military operation"
Strike_Witches_precursor.34.name:0 "Victory in Operation Victory Arrow"
Strike_Witches_precursor.34.desc:0 "As the witch joined the battlefield, the air supremacy was retaken, and after huge casualties, the planet’s capital was finally captured. Operation Victory Arrow was victorious. This action seemed to be related to the survival of the Witch Federation and the Chariot Alliance, so they Decided to hold a traditional ceremony on a deserted planet to celebrate this victory."
Strike_Witches_precursor.34.a:0 "what? they are going to celebrate?"
Strike_Witches_precursor.41.name:0 "Chariot race"
Strike_Witches_precursor.41.desc:0 "According to the remaining data, the political entities in their country in the Tank League are dominated by schools, and each school will exercise state power.

Strike_Witches_precursor.42.name:0 "Aviation exercise"
Strike_Witches_precursor.42.desc:0 "The Witch Federation conducted a grand aviation exercise during this celebration. It seems that the eight aviation regiments of the entire Federation have joined the exercise one after another, demonstrating a high level of air combat. At the end of the exercise, it seemed to have received an urgent notice requesting all the aviation groups to return to the home planet. It seemed that something big had happened. We simply used the ruins to locate the location of the Witch Federation's home planet, which is not far away."
Strike_Witches_precursor.42.a:0 "What happened to them？"
Strike_Witches_precursor.51.name:0 "New Fuso Maritime Incident"
Strike_Witches_precursor.51.desc:0 "In 2537 of the witch calendar, the allotype army appeared again on the mother planet of the witch federation. As all the 501 to 508 aviation regiments participated in the celebration meeting of Operation Victory Arrow, the military strength was severely insufficient. The army witch has tried its best to resist. The imperial government of Karlsland’s capital Berlin Tokyo, the capital of the Fuso Empire, has fallen one after another, and it seems that it is almost irresistible."
Strike_Witches_precursor.51.a:0 "Berlin and Tokyo? Their civilization also has a city with the same name as our civilization, we finally know that their enemy is called Alloytype Army"
Strike_Witches_precursor.52.name:0 "Operation South Wind"
Strike_Witches_precursor.52.desc:0 "In order to recapture Berlin, the Witch Federation seems to have ordered a plan called Operation Southwind, in which the 501 Aviation Regiment breaks into Berlin and destroys the core of the nest. The 502 Regiment in Petersburg will also feint from the side."

Strike_Witches_precursor.53.desc:0 "The Alloytype Army has awakened its new capabilities. It seems that the battle to retake Berlin has failed, and the aviation regiment has been hit hard! Taking this as an opportunity, the alien army captured the entire planet, and their home planet was lost!"
Strike_Witches_precursor.53.a:0 "Unexpectedly failed？！"
Strike_Witches_precursor.54.name:0 "Final destiny"
Strike_Witches_precursor.54.desc:0 "With the fall of the capital of the Witch Federation, the two empires could no longer continue to maintain the front, and the allotype army completely occupied the local area and continued to expand the army to conquer the entire galaxy. Millions of years have passed, and in our generation, it seems to have disappeared, and in the end it has not figured out what the allotype army is. We found the laboratory of the 507 Aviation Regiment in the Soms area of ​​the Witch Federation. There is a red crystal of regular twelve facets that is shining. According to the broken news in the laboratory, this is their enemy-the allotype army's large lair. The core, permanently blocked the regeneration ability through magic, so it can be researched. They seem to have stored the hope of civilization on a certain planet before they perish, and there may be more discoveries."
Strike_Witches_precursor.54.a:0 "In short, it is a worthwhile trip, and the last hopeful place to mention their civilization must be found!"
Strike_Witches_precursor.61.name:0 "Witch Gate"
Strike_Witches_precursor.61.desc:0 "The computer data left next to the gate showed that the gate of the Secret Land was composed of countless magical powers and magic circles. The only remaining witches were gathered here to seal the place to ensure that it would not be corroded in millions of years. At the same time, we also left a way to open up, hoping that some latecomers can unblock it."
